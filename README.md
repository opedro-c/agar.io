## Gameplay

In this game, players control their ball using the mouse. The objective is to consume small balls that randomly spawn on the map. Each consumed ball grants the player 1 point and increases the size of their ball. Players can also consume other players' balls if they have at least one more point than the target player. The game features public and private game rooms, where users can create and join multiplayer sessions. Public rooms are accessible to all users, while private rooms require a password to join. When the last user leaves a room, it is automatically deleted. After losing the game, players have the option to restart with zero points or exit to create/join another game room.

## Game Rooms

The game offers two types of rooms: public and private. Public rooms are open to all users, allowing them to join and play with other players. Private rooms, on the other hand, require a password for entry, providing a more exclusive gaming experience. Once the last user leaves a room, it is automatically removed from the system to optimize resources and ensure a fresh gaming environment.
